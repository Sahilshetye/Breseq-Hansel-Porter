# Breseq extractor

----------------------------------------------------------------------


this is a simple data extractor for breseq built using
* **Beautifull soup**
* **Cython**
* **VCF Reader**
* **Samtools(specially tabix)**

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The tool was written with a basic intent of extracting data
 from breseq  output file

 The Colum data was picked up and compared to our existing
 databases in the local network for further processing


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Further Improvement:

 - [ ] Ading Unit test
 - [ ] Adding ability to export data in CSV
 - [ ] Extending Soup to  out output.html in breseq (Currently only supports  index.html )
 - [ ] Improving the logging of the file
